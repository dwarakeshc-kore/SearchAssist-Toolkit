FAITHFULNESS_PROMPT = """You are evaluating whether a RAG system's answer is grounded in its retrieved content.

Given:
- QUESTION: the user's query
- RAG_ANSWER: the system's response
- RETRIEVED_DOCS: document IDs that were cited

Score FAITHFULNESS (1-5):
1 = answer makes claims not supported by any retrieved source
3 = answer is mostly grounded but contains 1-2 unsupported claims
5 = every claim in the answer is directly supported by the retrieved content

Also determine the FAILURE_CATEGORY (pick one):
- "none" — answer is correct and grounded
- "hallucination" — answer contains fabricated facts not in retrieved content
- "retrieval_miss" — expected document was not retrieved
- "wrong_refusal" — refused an answerable question
- "missed_refusal" — answered an out-of-scope question
- "off_topic" — answer doesn't address the question
- "incomplete" — answer is grounded but misses key information
